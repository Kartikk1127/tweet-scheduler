1,Everyone talks about scaling systems but how often do you think about scaling yourself. What does that look like for you?
2,If your career was a database, what indexes would you build right now to make your progress faster?
3,Choosing a database feels easy until you realize the wrong one is like using a sledgehammer to crack a peanut. What was the worst tool mismatch you have seen?
4,CDNs are like secret shortcuts for your data. Ever measured how much faster your app got after adding one?
5,The CAP theorem is less about limits and more about awareness. Which tradeoff would you choose if you had to?
6,Database indexes are magical until you realize they also need care. Have you ever had to remove one to make things faster?
7,A Bloom filter will happily guess but never promise. Where in your work could a small guess save you big time?
8,Client-side caching is like remembering a friend’s number instead of checking your contacts every time. Where have you seen it fail?
9,Consistent hashing quietly keeps distributed systems fair. Can you think of a time fairness mattered in your code?
10,Compression in APIs saves bandwidth but sometimes at the cost of CPU. If you had to choose, which is more valuable for you?
11,Message queues let you walk away after sending the letter and trust it will be delivered. What’s your favorite queue system?
12,A reverse proxy can be invisible yet critical. If yours went down today, what would break first?
13,Failover is boring until it saves you. Have you ever actually had to use one in production?
14,Load balancing feels simple until you realize it decides whether users stay or leave. What’s your go to strategy?
15,Good system design is not about making things bigger. It is about making them work better together. Agree or disagree?
16,Every outage teaches you something. What is the single biggest lesson you have learned from downtime?
17,Your first design is never your best design. How many iterations does it take for you to feel confident in one?
18,Scaling is easy to talk about when you have no users. What would you scale first if traffic doubled tonight?
19,Tradeoffs are the only universal law in engineering. Which tradeoff still bothers you the most?
20,Data without indexes is like a library without a catalog. Which is your favorite indexing strategy and why?
21,The fastest code is the code that never runs. Where have you removed logic and made something faster?
22,Resilience is built in the boring times. What boring thing saved you in production?
23,Designing for zero downtime is a challenge. Have you pulled it off successfully?
24,Every tech stack has skeletons in the closet. What is the one yours hides?
25,Caching feels like free speed until it serves you stale data. How do you deal with that?
26,Monitoring tells you what is happening but logging tells you why. Which one do you invest more in?
27,High availability sounds impressive until you do the math on cost. Would you pay double for 99.999 uptime?
28,The hardest part of distributed systems is agreeing on the truth. How do you keep your services in sync?
29,Your design should be so clear that new engineers understand it without a meeting. How close are you to that goal?
30,The best engineers I know are obsessed with deleting code. When was the last time you deleted more than you wrote
