1,Hello Twitter World!
2,Just like scaling a database, growing your career is about consistent small optimizations.
3,Choosing the right database is like choosing the right tool...overkill hurts as much as underkill.
4,CDNs are like having mini-warehouses everywhere so your users get data faster.
5,The CAP theorem isn’t about picking one, it’s about knowing your trade-offs.
6,Indexes in a database are like a book’s table of contents: faster lookups, but with a maintenance cost.
7,A Bloom filter is your bouncer...lets in likely members, turns away obvious strangers.
8,Client-side caching is like remembering your Wi-Fi password, no need to ask the server every time.
9,Consistent hashing is like a pizza cutter that ensures slices are fair even when guests join late.
10,Compression in APIs is like sending a zipped folder..smaller size, same content.
11,Message queues let you send a letter without waiting for the recipient to open it immediately.
12,A reverse proxy is your system’s receptionist,,,routes requests to the right service.
13,Failover systems are like parachutes—better to have one and not need it, than need it and not have it.
14,Load balancing is the art of splitting work so no server feels like Monday morning.
15,System design is not about complexity...it’s about making things simple at scale.
